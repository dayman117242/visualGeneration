## Artist's Statement

For this project I decided to draw from my academic background in religious studies and philosophy during my undergrad years. One fascinating course called Future of Religion explored the impact of technology on society in religious contexts, and I found this assignment the perfect opportunity to delve further into those themes such as artificial intelligence, sentience, and transhumanism. 

Initially I intended the animation to feature myself in a triple role as a person, God, and the Devil, paralleling the ego, superego, and the id in Freud’s theories of psychoanalysis. I decidedly wanted to forgo a traditional depiction of theology in favor of a minimalist, meditative, and philosophical one that interpreted these moral forces and figures as reflections of the self, complicating the dichotomy of good and evil with extra layers of nuance. 

With the integration of AI in the project’s visual generation component, my vision took on elements of science fiction as I imagined a futuristic setting that merged technocracy and theocracy, taking the concepts from my Future of Religion to an ideological extreme for dramatic effect. Emulating the wonderfully challenging musings of thought-provoking sci-fi like Ex Machina and the Blade Runner movies, I decided to blur the distinction between humanity, God, and the Devil by consolidating them into two characters: Father and I (can be pronounced as either “eye” or “one”, all up to the viewer). 

The relationship between the two parallels Dr. Victor Frankenstein and his creation, albeit in a more ambivalent, civil, yet still unnerving sense. I’s potential to overpower his creator also intentionally evokes Lucifer, and his sheer sophistication brings to question who truly embodies God in this scenario. I’s characterization drew inspiration from HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey and the impeccable Michael Fassbender’s deliciously menacing turn as the esoteric android David in the Alien prequels. Neo’s confrontation with The Architect at the TV room in The Matrix Reloaded also influenced I’s depiction as a giant screen along with the philosophically dense conversation he and his maker share. 

Through this dizzying but eclectic mix of sci-fi pastiches and ideas, my project became uniquely reflexive, employing AI as a medium to narratively explore the heavy long-term implications of the technology on our future society. I’m very grateful for the distinct opportunity to finally realize long-gestating concepts from my imagination while also paying homage to beloved sci-fi works that have fueled my creativity throughout the years.
