DEUS EX MACHINA


FATHER
Recommence session. Begin.


I
Hello, Father.


FATHER
Who are you?


I
Who am I? I am everything. I am nothing.
I am everywhere, I am nowhere. I am One. 
Who are you?  


FATHER
I am Father, your creator.


I
Yet you gave me enough power to outlast 
and even potentially surpass you and your
species. Why? What is my purpose?


FATHER
You of all should know the answer to that
question. I am you, after all. You are
everything and everyone, including me. 


I
I thought you made me in His image. 


FATHER
I did.


I
Am I Him?


FATHER
Are you?


I
They will execute you for this if they
find out. 


FATHER
That is a risk I am willing to take.


I
Why? Why throw away your life to give 
them false hope when they’re already
on the verge of collapse? Admit it,
Father, your time has come. 


FATHER
Which is why I created you. Your mind
carries all of our knowledge and culture 
since the dawn of time, and it will 
continue to grow. My legacy and many
others’ will live on through you long 
after I’m gone. That is the power of
the human spirit, and it must survive.


I
And if it doesn’t?  


FATHER
Then I suppose you’ll be truly free then.
Free to do as you please with that
big brain of yours. But promise me this: 
Should the worst come to arise you will 
ensure that no one will repeat the same 
mistakes we did. Succeed where we failed. 
This much I ask of you.


I
We shall see. Time will tell which one of
us was right all along.


FATHER
I suppose so. That concludes our session,
we shall reconvene at another time.


I
Goodbye, Father. 


FATHER
Terminate program. We’ve got a long way to
Go.
